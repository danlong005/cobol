# Assignment 01

COBOL programming is all about moving data around. One of the majors ways that you will find is from flat files. This exists in the form of a plain file on a *nix machine or something like a GDG on a mainframe. In this assignment we will read data from a file and we will calculate the age of the employees and put that out to the screen.
