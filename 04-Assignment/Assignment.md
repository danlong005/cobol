# Assignment 03

We have worked with flat files and done input and output files. Now let's work with SQL in our program. We will do the same project but this time we will read this from a database table. We will then insert the data into a new table.

# Input
```
001Clark          Kent               1980-01-01
002Tony           Stark              1999-05-04
003Bruce          Wayne              1965-07-04
```

# Output
```
001Clark          Kent               1980-01-01 42
002Tony           Stark              1999-05-04 22
003Bruce          Wayne              1965-07-04 56
